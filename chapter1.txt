Use the following add-permission command to trust the CloudWatch Events service principal (events.amazonaws.com) and scope permissions to the rule with the specified Amazon Resource Name (ARN):

aws lambda add-permission \
--function-name LogScheduledEvent \
--statement-id my-scheduled-event \
--action 'lambda:InvokeFunction' \
--principal events.amazonaws.com \
--source-arn arn:aws:events:us-east-1:123456789012:rule/my-scheduled-rule

Use the following put-targets command to add the Lambda function that you created to this rule so that it runs every five minutes:

aws events put-targets --rule my-scheduled-rule --targets file://targets.json

Create the file targets.json with the following contents:

    [
      {
        "Id": "1", 
        "Arn": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789012:function:LogScheduledEvent"
      }
    ]

Step 3: Verify the Rule

At least five minutes after completing Step 2, you can verify that your Lambda function was invoked.

To test your rule

    Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/

.

In the navigation pane, choose Events, Rules, select the name of the rule that you created, and choose Show metrics for the rule.

To view the output from your Lambda function, do the following:

    In the navigation pane, choose Logs.

    Select the name of the log group for your Lambda function (/aws/lambda/function-name).

    Select the name of log stream to view the data provided by t
